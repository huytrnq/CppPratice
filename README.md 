## Object Oriented Programming
- Include guard: To prevent the header file from being included more than once in the same file.
- Constructor overloading: A class can have more than one constructor.
- Copy constructor: A constructor that creates an object by copying variables from another object.
- Destructor: A special member function that is called when the object goes out of scope or is deleted.
- Constructor initializer list: A list of initializations for member objects.
- Copy constructor: 
    + A constructor that creates an object by copying variables from another object.
    + If a class does not have a copy constructor, the compiler will create one.
    + If a class has a pointer to memory, the default copy constructor will copy the pointer, not the memory.
- Shwallow copy vs Deep copy:
    + Shallow copy: Only the pointer is copied, not the memory.
    + Deep copy: The memory is copied.
- Move Constructor: A constructor that moves the memory from one object to another.
    + The copy constructor is called when the object is passed by value.
    + The move constructor is called when the object is passed by rvalue reference.
    + The move constructor helps to avoid unnecessary copying of memory.

# Static vs Dynamic Libraries
- Static libraries are linked to the executable at compile time.
- Dynamic libraries are linked to the executable at run time.
- Dynamic libraries are loaded into memory when the program starts and are shared among all the processes that use the library. May have worse performance than static libraries.
